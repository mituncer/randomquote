The web application consists of two main pages: the landing page (index.html) and the revision page (revlist.html).

On the landing page, users can input their own quotes or tasks, and each day a random item from the inputted list is displayed. 
Users have the option to either keep the displayed item throughout the day or rotate to a new item. 
Additionally, a random quote is shown from the web to provide daily inspiration.

The revision page allows users to manage their notes and ideas. 
Users can add new items to the list, remove existing items, and view a randomly selected note at the top of the container.

The JavaScript files (index.js and revlist.js) provide the functionality for retrieving and saving data in local storage, generating random items, 
rendering the lists, and handling user interactions.

Together, these components create a web application that helps users manage their self notes, ideas, and daily inspirations, 
providing an organized and dynamic experience.
